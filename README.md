# Text-Editor-Project
The aim of this project is to create a basic text editor. This text editor will also highlight specific parts of the code based on the Python syntax. This will be achieved by first processing the text input. Then tokenize the code, which is where the code would be broken into smaller pieces of meaningful code. From there, parse the structure of the code, and apply the relevant syntax rules. Therefore, by the end, the text editor will highlight the important parts of the code. This would include highlighting keywords, functions, identifiers, and other elements that are a part of the Python language.
